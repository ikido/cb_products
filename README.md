### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
Open http://localhost:5001
```

### TODO

* convert other layout elements — header, sidebar, footer and main container

* make production build — fix production webpack config, create file with common webpack config


### TODO later

* using google font from web, not good, we need to use local one

* lots of stylesheet files, already minified — not good, we need them unminified and managed by webpack

* images should also be managed by webpack, not sure how at this point

* use browserHistory for react-router, but server must support it
