### Development

```
npm install
npm start
Open http://localhost:5001
```


### Deploy
`npm build`, then deploy `/dist` folder



### TODO later

* using google font from web, not good, we need to use local one

* lots of stylesheet files, already minified â€” not good, we need them unminified and managed by webpack

* images should also be managed by webpack, not sure how at this point

* use browserHistory for react-router, but server must support it
